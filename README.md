# Federated Learning for Personalized Gastric Cancer Treatment: A systematic review of literature

## Overview

This repository contains a systematic literature review conducted to explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) in the diagnosis of gastric cancer. The review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) model, providing a comprehensive evaluation of existing studies and research papers in this domain.

## Objective

The primary objective of this review is to:
1. **Examine the application of federated learning in medical imaging and diagnostics** for gastric cancer.
2. **Identify key trends, challenges, and future research directions** in the field.
3. **Evaluate the effectiveness of FL in improving diagnostic accuracy** while preserving data privacy and scalability in distributed hospital settings.

## Methodology

The review process follows the PRISMA model, consisting of the following key steps:
1. **Identification**: Keywords and database searches were used to find relevant studies.
2. **Screening**: Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
3. **Inclusion**: Relevant papers were selected based on their contribution to the topic of federated learning in gastric cancer diagnosis.

## Data

The dataset includes a list of research papers relevant to the application of FL in gastric cancer diagnosis. This dataset has been compiled and analyzed for the systematic review. The selection of studies was based on:
- Inclusion of federated learning in the methodology.
- Focus on gastric cancer or related medical diagnostics.
- Peer-reviewed articles and conference papers from the last some years.

## Key Findings

- **Enhanced Model Performance**: Federated learning models demonstrated improvements in diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for gastric cancer diagnosis compared to traditional models.
- **Scalability**: The FL models improved scalability, allowing for efficient data processing across distributed hospital datasets.
- **Data Privacy**: Federated learning models maintained data privacy while ensuring accurate results, making them suitable for healthcare applications.

## Research Gaps

- Many studies focused more on model correctness rather than real-world challenges such as scalability, communication efficiency, and data privacy.
- Data heterogeneity across hospitals and institutions has not been adequately addressed in previous studies, which affects model performance.
- Future research should explore the integration of advanced FL techniques, including personalized federated learning and model compression.

## Future Work

Federated learning holds significant promise for improving diagnostic accuracy in healthcare, particularly for gastric cancer. Future research should focus on:
- Refining federated learning models for better handling of data heterogeneity and scalability.
- Exploring the integration of real-time data analytics and edge computing for improved patient outcomes.
- Expanding the application of FL to other medical conditions and datasets.
